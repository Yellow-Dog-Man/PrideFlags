# What is this?
These are LGBTQ+ pride flag icons. We've made these specifically for Resonite - a social VR sandbox platform where you can build anything in-game ( https://resonite.com ) to allow users assign these to their profile and display them on their name badges.

# Why make this?
Both our team and community have a lot of LGBTQ+ members and we want to support them and their representation. Pride badges were already popular with badge injectors, with many users wearing them on name badges - but those would not display when custom name badges were off. We decided to add these officially, so they will always display!

Pride month of 2025 provided a good excuse to do this, however these are staying even beyond that!

# Why make this repository public and CC0?
- We want people to use them! If you want to use them in your own project to provide LGBTQ+ representation, please do!
- When we were looking for badges to implement, we couldn't find any set with permissive license
- We want to accept potential contributions - e.g. additional badges, tweaks and so on
-- However we do reserve right to evalute the contributions and potentially reject them - this is not a gurantee we'll accept your PR. At very least any PR needs to match the existing style to keep things consistent.

# Do I need to credit you when I use these?
You don't! CC0 doesn't require attribution. However if you do decide to give us a shoutout it's very much appreciated!
